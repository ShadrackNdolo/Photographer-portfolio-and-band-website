    <p>Joel Thomas Zimmerman (born January 5, 1981), better known by his stage name deadmau5 (pronounced "dead mouse"), is a Canadian record producer and DJ from Toronto, Ontario. Zimmerman produces a variety of styles within the progressive house genre
      and sometimes other forms of electronic music. His tracks have been included in numerous compilation albums, such as the 2007 In Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza CD. The February 2008 issue of Mixmag's music magazine included a free CD which was titled
      MixMag Presents: The Hottest New Name In Dance! DEADMAU5 Tech-Trance-Electro-Madness, mixed by Zimmerman. Tracks have also been included and presented on Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance radio show. His debut album, Get Scraped, was released
      in 2005, followed by others in the next few years.</p>
